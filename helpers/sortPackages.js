/**
 * Packages are sorted in the following stacks:
 * A package is bulky if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³
 *  or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
 * A package is heavy when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.
 * STANDARD: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
 * SPECIAL: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
 * REJECTED: packages that are both heavy and bulky are rejected.
 * @param {*} width the width of the package in centimeters
 * @param {*} height the height of the package in centimeters
 * @param {*} length the length of the package in centimeters
 * @param {*} mass the weight of the package in kilogram
 * @returns {string} the name of the stack where the package should go.
